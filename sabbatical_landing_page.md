![Examine Process](https://sabbatical.travel/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Stocksy_comp_4051943.jpg)

### 01 Examine

In this multistep process, we ask what and why so that we can provide a how. After an introductory behavioral analysis, we pair our clients with a highly-skilled Guide who will help determine what curated journey best services their unique personal and professional ambitions. Our Guide will also provide additional materials to deepen the experience ahead.
